# Docker Compose Documentation

This guide explains how to create a `docker-compose.yml` file and the meaning of its common parameters.

## What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With a simple YAML file, you can configure your application's services, networks, and volumes, and bring them up with a single command.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

## Steps to Create a `docker-compose.yml` File

### 1. Create a directory for your project

Create a directory where your application and Docker Compose configuration will live. For example:

```bash
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
```
2. Create a docker-compose.yml file
In the project directory, create a docker-compose.yml file:

```bash Copy code
touch docker-compose.yml
```
3. Define services in the YAML file
Add the services you want to run inside your docker-compose.yml file. Hereâ€™s an example:

```yaml  Copy code
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
    networks:
      - my-network

  database:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - my-network

volumes:
  db-data:

networks:
  my-network:
```
4. Start services with Docker Compose
Run the following command to start all services defined in the docker-compose.yml file:

```bash Copy code
docker-compose up
You can add the -d flag to run services in detached mode:
```
```bash Copy code
docker-compose up -d
```
5. Stop services
To stop the services, use:

```bash Copy code
docker-compose down
```
Common Parameters in docker-compose.yml

version
Description: Defines the version of the Docker Compose file format.
Example: version: '3.8'
Options: The version should correspond to the capabilities you want to use. The latest is 3.x.
services
Description: Defines the containers that Docker Compose will manage.
Example:
yaml
Copy code
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
Options: Each service can have multiple parameters such as image, build, ports, volumes, etc.
image
Description: Specifies the Docker image to be used for a service.
Example: image: nginx:latest
Options: You can provide any valid image from Docker Hub or your custom image.
build
Description: Specifies the build context and optionally a Dockerfile to build the image locally.
Example:
yaml
Copy code
build:
  context: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile
ports
Description: Maps ports on the host to ports on the container.
Example: ports: ["8080:80"]
Options: The format is host_port:container_port.
volumes
Description: Mounts host directories or named volumes inside containers.
Example:
yaml
Copy code
volumes:
  - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
Options: You can specify either a relative path from the project directory or a named volume.
environment
Description: Sets environment variables for a service.
Example:
yaml
Copy code
environment:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
networks
Description: Defines networks that services will use to communicate.
Example:
yaml
Copy code
networks:
  - my-network
Options: You can define custom networks or use the default one.
volumes (top-level)
Description: Defines named volumes that can be reused across services.
Example:
yaml
Copy code
volumes:
  db-data:
networks (top-level)
Description: Defines custom networks that can be reused across services.
Example:
yaml
Copy code
networks:
  my-network:
Example of a Simple Docker Compose File
Here is an example of a docker-compose.yml file that defines a web service (nginx) and a database service (MySQL):

yaml
Copy code
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db-data:
Conclusion
With this setup, you can easily configure and manage multi-container Docker applications using a docker-compose.yml file. You can define services, networks, and volumes, and bring your application up or down with a single command.

For more advanced configurations, refer to the official Docker Compose documentation.
